# Ex.No: 11  Planning â€“  Block World Problem 
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040185
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Block word problem using PDDL  
###  Algorithm:
Step 1 :  Start the program <br>
Step 2 : Create a domain for Block world Problem <br>
Step 3 :  Create a domain by specifying predicates clear, on table, on, arm-empty, holding. <br>
Step 4 : Specify the actions pickup, putdown, stack and un-stack in Block world problem <br>
Step 5 :  In pickup action, Robot arm pick the block on table. Precondition is Block is on table and no other block on specified block and arm-hand empty.<br>
Step 6:  In putdown action, Robot arm place the block on table. Precondition is robot-arm holding the block.<br>
Step 7 : In un-stack action, Robot arm pick the block on some block. Precondition is Block is on another block and no other block on specified block and arm-hand empty.<br>
Step 8 : In stack action, Robot arm place the block on under block. Precondition is Block holded by robot arm and no other block on under block.<br>
Step 9 : Define a problem for block world problem.<br> 
Step 10 : Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 
     
### Program:
### domain.pddl :
     (define (domain blocksworld) 
     (:requirements :strips :equality) 
     (:predicates (clear ?x) 
      (on-table ?x) 
      (arm-empty) 
      (holding ?x) 
      (on ?x ?y)) 
     (:action pickup 
      :parameters (?ob) 
      :precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty)) 
      :effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (on-table ?ob)) 
      (not (arm-empty)))) 
     (:action putdown 
      :parameters (?ob) 
      :precondition (and (holding ?ob)) 
      :effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob) 
      (not (holding ?ob)))) 
     (:action stack 
      :parameters (?ob ?underob) 
      :precondition (and (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob)) 
      :effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob) 
      (not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob)))) 
     (:action unstack 
      :parameters (?ob ?underob) 
      :precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob) (arm-empty)) 
      :effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob) 
      (not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty))))) 


### Input :

### Problem 1: Problem.pddl 

     (define (problem pb1) 
      (:domain blocksworld) 
      (:objects a b) 
      (:init (on-table a) (on-table b) (clear a) (clear b) (arm-empty)) 
      (:goal (and (on a b)))) 

### Problem 2: Problem2.pddl 
     (define(problem pb3) 
      (:domain blocksworld) 
      (:objects a b c) 
      (:init (on-table a) (on-table b) (on-table c) 
      (clear a) (clear b) (clear c) (arm-empty)) 
      (:goal (and (on a b) (on b c)))) 

### Output/Plan:

### Result:
Thus the plan was found for the initial and goal state of block world problem.
